## Motors and Transistors
*Before coming to the lab session*, watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/5bHPKU4ybHY).
[![Lab 5](NPN.png)](https://youtu.be/5bHPKU4ybHY).


## Pre-lab Questions

Write a pre-lab report by answering the following questions. Submit it BEFORE the beginning of the class.
```
Q1. Why do we use transistor to control a motor (instead of directly control it)?

Q2. Explain how to use NPN transistor to control a motor. 

Q3. Explain the difference between DC and servo moters.
```


## Exercise
