## Motors and Transistors
*Before coming to the lab session*, watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/5bHPKU4ybHY).
[![Lab 5](NPN.png)](https://youtu.be/5bHPKU4ybHY).


## Pre-lab Questions

Write a pre-lab report by answering the following questions. Submit it BEFORE the beginning of the class.
```
Q1. Why do we use transistor to control a motor (instead of directly control it)?
    Explain how to use NPN transistor to control a motor. 

Q2. Explain the difference between DC and servo moters.

Q3. In the lab, we will use 2N4401 NPN transister. Search for the the spec and summarize key information you need.
```
